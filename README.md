# Helm Dashboard

A simplified way of working with Helm.


## Roadmap

### Internal Milestone 1
- Helm Plugin Packaging
- CLI launcher
- Web Server with REST API


### First Public Version
Listing the installed applications
View k8s resources created by the application (describe, status)
Viewing revision history for application
View manifest diffs between revisions, also changelogs etc
Analytics reporting (telemetry)

### Further Ideas
Setting parameter values and installing
Installing new app from repo
Uninstalling the app completely
Reconfiguring the application
Rollback a revision

Validate manifests before deploy and get better errors
Switch clusters (?)
Browsing repositories
Adding new repository
